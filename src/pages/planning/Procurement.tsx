Check whether AI is incorporated into the digital health system you are considering.

A high level of interoperability between your software systems means there is a reduced likelihood of complex and energy intensive integration or replacement projects now and in the future. <p></p>Interoperability in software is usually achieved through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Check what API standards the software adheres to and how that compares with API standards of any existing or planned software you may want the digital health system to integrate with.

This is because it may be difficult to separate out the element of their ongoing phone costs that are attributable to the digital health system.

As well as prolonging the lifespan of the software, this reduces the risk of service-related equipment becoming obsolescent as the software running on it is no longer supported. <p></p>Be aware that owing to the fast evolution of technology and the consequent expectations around it, it is possible for the lifespan of digital systems to be over extended. So, for example, a digital health system user interface, for the patient or healthcare professional, might appear increasingly clunky as it ages, and this might ultimately result in the patient or healthcare professional not using it. Clearly it would then not achieve its intended health benefits and yet still be running with the associated environmental impacts."

Spatial shifting means allowing your processing to run at a data centre in a different location when the energy supply to the primary data centre is low in renewables. Clearly the degree to which you can fine-tune a Digital Health system may be limited â€“ data processing to provide monitoring, for example, may need to be happening constantly.
